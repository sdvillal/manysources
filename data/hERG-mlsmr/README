We then will use the activities provided in this article:
  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118324

This is how they processed the data:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Structural data for molecules annotated for hERG block used
to develop binary classifiers by Robinson, et al. [10],
and Doddareddy, et al. [4] were obtained from the original publications.
The structure files for the MLSMR collection of 306,985 compounds screened
in high-throughput format [37] were obtained from the PubChem database.
Each collection was computationally filtered for solvent fragments,
charge and stereochemistry standardized, and both canonical SMILES strings
and molecular fingerprints were calculated using Pipeline Pilot v 6.1.5
(Scitegic, Inc. Accelrys). Additional molecular descriptors used to train
the Winnow model and display the chemical space of uncharged hERG blockers
were computed using the JChem (ChemAxon) cxcalc plugin.

We will just download these compunds for which activities are provided
We will use the smiles provided by pubchem (the goal is not to be serious about prepro)
One can download also sdfs, inchis, (+ conformers...) using PUG API or the PubChem web
